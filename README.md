Control Hue lights with a Griffin Powermate


hueDimmer.py is a simple python program to control Phillips Hue lights via a Griffin Powermate.
It supports toggling all the lights, changing the brightness, and changing the color temperature of the lights.

At the moment it is very dirty, but is functional. It is in the process of becoming presentable.

To use it, follow the instructions on http://developers.meethue.com/gettingstarted.html to set up your Hue hub
with a user named NewDeveloper. Then edit the hueDimmer.py file to use the ip address of your hub.

The whole project should be getting some updates soon to make setup easier (i.e. automated), and this README should
be updated to be less terrible (i.e. describe functinoality, use case, motive, etc)... assuming I don't
get lazy over the next few days.
