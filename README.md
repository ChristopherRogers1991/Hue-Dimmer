Control Hue lights with a Griffin Powermate


hueDimmer.py is a simple python program to control Phillips Hue lights via a Griffin Powermate.
It supports toggling all the lights, changing the brightness, and changing the color temperature of the lights.

At the moment it is very dirty, but it meets my needs. Until my needs change, I am unlikely to make any changes to the code.

To use it, follow the instructions on http://developers.meethue.com/gettingstarted.html to set up your Hue hub
with a user named NewDeveloper. Then edit the hueDimmer.py file to use the ip address of your hub.
