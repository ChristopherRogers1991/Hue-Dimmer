udev rules are required to use as non root. The the powermate and uinput must be
set such that groups have read and write access (possible just read for the
powermate, and just write for uinput). These should be created with a script
which checks if there is already a group with access to those devices, and
adds the user to said group. Otherwise, it should create a group, and add the
user, and create the necessary udev rules.
